## Dev Feature

- Special Lib

    - `Chunky` (Server side chunk pre-generation tool)

## Development

[Pakku Cli](https://github.com/juraj-hrivnak/Pakku) is the modpack manager that this repository uses.

> Pakku has no support for mixing Neoforge and Fabric mods, but `Sinytra Connector` exist.
> The work around for now is to place them as manual override in `.pakku` directory, and they won't be updated.
